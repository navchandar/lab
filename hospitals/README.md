## Hospital Network Visualization

Standard industry practice currently provides in-network and excluded hospital lists via static, unstructured PDF documents.

This project aims to transform this inaccessible data into an interactive geospatial visualization. 

In emergency situations, proximity is often the primary factor in selecting a facility. A map-based interface allows users to instantly verify the status of the nearest hospital.

For individuals traveling or moving to new locations, this tool facilitates preliminary checks of local healthcare infrastructure.


### In-Network Hospitals

These hospitals have a direct contract with your insurance company and integrated into the insurer's direct settlement network.

Policyholders are typically eligible for Cashless Treatment, wherein the insurer settles bills directly with the hospital. This minimizes the policyholder's immediate out-of-pocket expenses.


### Out-of-Network Hospitals

These hospitals don't have a special contract with your insurer.

Treatment is generally permissible; however, the financial burden initially falls on the policyholder. Claims must be filed for Reimbursement post-treatment. 

Note: While initiatives such as "Cashless Everywhere" aim to bridge this gap, they remain subject to conditional approvals and specific administrative protocols.


### Excluded Hospitals (The "Banned List")

These hospitals are blacklisted and explicitly flagged by the insurer or regulatory bodies. Claims originating from excluded providers are summarily rejected and the policyholder bears 100% of the cost.
