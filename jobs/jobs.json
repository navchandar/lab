Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem.

We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.About the Team The Observability team is part of Roku’s Cloud Technology Infrastructure organization and plays a critical role for our platform. We are a high-performing, fast-moving international team that thrives on ownership, effective communication, and delivering impactful engineering solutions. Our mission is to advance Roku’s observability platform, which operates at an impressive scale by ingesting terabytes of data daily and managing hundreds of millions of active series. As part of this mission, we focus on building scalable, performant systems to meet Roku’s unique needs. By leveraging open-source tools, CNCF-supported projects, and custom solutions, we enable engineering teams across Roku to monitor, debug, and optimize their applications with ease. What sets us apart is our results-driven culture rooted in ownership, accountability, and fast iteration. We prioritize solving meaningful engineering problems, fostering collaboration, and continuously improving how we work as a team. About the Role You will work on core observability systems (metrics, logs, traces) while also developing robust data pipelines and storage solutions optimized for high throughput, performance, and cost. You’ll leverage technologies such as time-series databases (TSDB), columnar storage formats (e.g., Parquet), and distributed data processing frameworks to advance the platform’s capabilities. Collaboration with cross-functional teams will be critical, as you’ll integrate observability into Roku’s cloud-native stack and contribute improvements back to the open-source community. Extend and integrate open-source observability systems, and when needed, structurally overhaul core components, such as storage layers and query paths, to improve performance, reliability, and usability of these tools at scale. Build services to improve performance, usability, reliability, and cost efficiency. Implement features like pre-aggregation, downsampling, and sampling to reduce load and accelerate queries. Create developer-facing capabilities for metrics, logs, and traces usage, data quality, and cost management. Automate onboarding, dashboards, alerting, and tracing. Collaborate across platform and infrastructure teams to integrate observability into Roku’s cloud-native stack. What We’re Looking For 8+ years in software engineering building distributed, high-throughput systems or observability platforms. 4+ years of Go experience; our observability ecosystem is Go-based, making it the most effective language for this role. Experience with, or strong interest in, observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, ELK/OpenSearch, Clickhouse) and standards (OpenTelemetry, OpenTracing, OpenMetrics). Deep understanding of distributed systems and data models Hands-on experience with Kubernetes, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure). BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines. About the Team Roku’s Search & Recommendations (S&R) Platform Engineering team is central to our mission of delivering outstanding streaming experiences to millions of people around the world. We develop and maintain the core platform that powers search, personalization, and content discovery at scale across every Roku device and service. We are a technically diverse and collaborative team that values ownership, transparency, and a culture of continuous improvement. We work closely with colleagues across platforms and infrastructure teams to deliver high-performance distributed systems and observability capabilities that enable real-time search, ranking, and recommendations. Our work includes designing and optimizing online inference infrastructure, feature stores, and data pipelines — all seamlessly integrated with the broader platform ecosystem (Kubernetes, Istio, Envoy). We’re passionate about solving complex technical challenges that have a direct impact on how users experience Roku. About the Role We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer with experience in building scalable, reliable software to help evolve and extend the infrastructure behind our Search and Recommendations platform.

You’ll contribute to the design, development, and operation of critical software and systems that power real-time search and personalised recommendations for millions of users. You’ll help shape the roadmap for our next-generation architecture, building standardisation and tooling efforts, and drive best practices in observability and resilience. We are a fast-moving team with a strong engineering culture built on clear communication, thoughtful decision-making, and a shared commitment to delivering impactful solutions. Collaboration is fundamental to how we work — we invest as much in supporting our growth as we do in building exceptional systems.

Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.
