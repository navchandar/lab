      "description": "Data is at the core of modern business, yet many teams struggle with its overwhelming volume and complexity. At Atlan, we’re changing that. As the world’s first active metadata platform, we help organisations transform data chaos into clarity and seamless collaboration.\n\nFrom Fortune 500 leaders to hyper-growth startups, from automotive innovators redefining mobility to healthcare organisations saving lives, and from Wall Street powerhouses to Silicon Valley trailblazers — we empower ambitious teams across industries to unlock the full potential of their data.\n\nRecognised as leaders by Gartner and Forrester and backed by Insight Partners, Atlan is at the forefront of reimagining how humans and data work together. Joining us means becoming part of a movement to shape a future where data drives extraordinary outcomes.\n\nPosition Overview\n\nIn this hybrid role you will be responsible for both individual customer success and enabling the growth of the team. You’ll be responsible for managing a portfolio of growth-oriented customers in the U.S. (primarily mid-market sized companies) while simultaneously serving as a coach and support system for Growth Customer Success Managers. This role is critical for creating leverage for Atlan, ensuring consistent high-quality customer experiences, and helping teammates improve through feedback, shadowing, and hands-on coaching. Your goal is to ensure our customers not only adopt Atlan effectively but also achieve long-term value and success with our platform.\n\nWhat will you do? 🤔\n\n* Portfolio Ownership: Act as the primary point of contact for a defined book of 15-20 growth accounts in the U.S., guiding them toward long-term success and ensuring they achieve maximum value from Atlan. You'll own the end-to-end customer relationship, driving adoption, expansion, and renewal.\n* Pod Enablement: Provide day-to-day coaching and tactical guidance to a small team of Growth CSMs. Help them troubleshoot challenges, prioritize work, build confidence, and develop their skills to effectively manage their own customer portfolios. Serve as a go-to resource for both tactical problem-solving and strategic alignment. Serve as a sounding board to help them grow and succeed in their roles.\n* Scale Operational Excellence: Partner with Success Ops to refine internal processes, improve visibility into customer health, and build a scalable model. This includes contributing to playbooks, reporting dashboards, and other resources that enable the team to operate efficiently and effectively.\n* Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with Product, Sales, Solutions Engineering, and Support to ensure a seamless customer experience. Advocate for customer needs and provide feedback to internal teams to improve our product and services.\n* Thought Leadership: Contribute feedback loops into product, process, and strategy to elevate Atlan’s value across the customer lifecycle. Share your insights and best practices with the broader CS team and contribute to the development of thought leadership content.\n\nWhat makes you a great match for us? 😍\n\n* Proven Dual Capacity: Experience as a top-performing CSM or CS leader supporting mid-market data customers at scale, ideally with 1+ years in a team lead or mentorship role. You have a proven track record of successfully managing customer relationships and driving adoption, expansion, and renewals.\n* Strategic & Tactical: You’re equally comfortable presenting to a VP of Data and helping a junior CSM prep for a renewal call. You can seamlessly transition between high-level strategic discussions and hands-on tactical support.\n* Data Ecosystem Fluency: Deep understanding of modern data tools (e.g., Snowflake, dbt, Tableau, Looker) and the challenges of data teams at growing companies. You understand the data landscape and can effectively communicate the value of Atlan to technical and business audiences.\n* Process & Systems Mindset: You’ve helped build or improve CS workflows, playbooks, or reporting systems — and focus on improving 1% every day. You're passionate about creating scalable and efficient processes that enable the team to deliver exceptional customer experiences.\n* Growth-Oriented: You thrive in ambiguity and are energized by helping others grow through direct feedback and real-time coaching. You're a natural leader who is passionate about developing and mentoring others.\n\nWhy Atlan for You?\n\nAt Atlan, we believe the future belongs to the humans of data. From curing diseases to advancing space exploration, data teams are powering humanity's greatest achievements. Yet, working with data can be chaotic—our mission is to transform that experience. We're reimagining how data teams collaborate by building the home they deserve, enabling them to create winning data cultures and drive meaningful progress.\n\nJoining Atlan Means\n\n* Ownership from Day One: Whether you're an intern or a full-time teammate, you’ll own impactful projects, chart your growth, and collaborate with some of the best minds in the industry.\n* Limitless Opportunities: At Atlan, your growth has no boundaries. If you’re ready to take initiative, the sky’s the limit.\n* A Global Data Community: We’re deeply embedded in the modern data stack, contributing to open-source projects, sponsoring meet-ups, and empowering team members to grow through conferences and learning opportunities.\n\nAs a fast-growing, fully remote company trusted by global leaders like Cisco, Nasdaq, and HubSpot, we’re creating a category-defining platform for data and AI governance. Backed by top investors, we’ve achieved 7X revenue growth in two years and are building a talented team spanning 15+ countries.\n\nIf you’re ready to do your life’s best work and help shape the future of data collaboration, join Atlan and become part of a mission to empower the humans of data to achieve more, together.\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer\n\nAt Atlan, we’re committed to helping data teams do their lives’ best work. We believe that diversity and authenticity are the cornerstones of innovation, and by embracing varied perspectives and experiences, we can create a workplace where everyone thrives.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.About the Team The Observability team is part of Roku’s Cloud Technology Infrastructure organization and plays a critical role for our platform. We are a high-performing, fast-moving international team that thrives on ownership, effective communication, and delivering impactful engineering solutions. Our mission is to advance Roku’s observability platform, which operates at an impressive scale by ingesting terabytes of data daily and managing hundreds of millions of active series. As part of this mission, we focus on building scalable, performant systems to meet Roku’s unique needs. By leveraging open-source tools, CNCF-supported projects, and custom solutions, we enable engineering teams across Roku to monitor, debug, and optimize their applications with ease. What sets us apart is our results-driven culture rooted in ownership, accountability, and fast iteration. We prioritize solving meaningful engineering problems, fostering collaboration, and continuously improving how we work as a team. About the Role You will work on core observability systems (metrics, logs, traces) while also developing robust data pipelines and storage solutions optimized for high throughput, performance, and cost. You’ll leverage technologies such as time-series databases (TSDB), columnar storage formats (e.g., Parquet), and distributed data processing frameworks to advance the platform’s capabilities. Collaboration with cross-functional teams will be critical, as you’ll integrate observability into Roku’s cloud-native stack and contribute improvements back to the open-source community. Extend and integrate open-source observability systems, and when needed, structurally overhaul core components, such as storage layers and query paths, to improve performance, reliability, and usability of these tools at scale. Build services to improve performance, usability, reliability, and cost efficiency. Implement features like pre-aggregation, downsampling, and sampling to reduce load and accelerate queries. Create developer-facing capabilities for metrics, logs, and traces usage, data quality, and cost management. Automate onboarding, dashboards, alerting, and tracing. Collaborate across platform and infrastructure teams to integrate observability into Roku’s cloud-native stack. What We’re Looking For 8+ years in software engineering building distributed, high-throughput systems or observability platforms. 4+ years of Go experience; our observability ecosystem is Go-based, making it the most effective language for this role. Experience with, or strong interest in, observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, ELK/OpenSearch, Clickhouse) and standards (OpenTelemetry, OpenTracing, OpenMetrics). Deep understanding of distributed systems and data models Hands-on experience with Kubernetes, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure). BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.
