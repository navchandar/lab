      "description": "Who are we?\n\nWhatfix is a leading global B2B SaaS provider and the largest pure-play digital adoption platform (DAP). Whatfix empowers organizations to maximize the ROI of their digital investments by tailoring it for the needs of each unique user.\n\nSpearheading the category with serial innovation and unmatched customer-centricity, Whatfix is the only DAP innovating beyond the category. Their product suite offers three powerful tools: Digital adoption to help users right within any software, no-code Product Analytics to uncover and resolve adoption gaps, and Mirror for application simulation, driving safe, hands-on learning in software replicas.\n\nThe company has seven offices across the US, India, UK, Germany, Singapore, and Australia and a presence across 40+ countries.\n\nCustomers: 700+ enterprise customers, including 80+ Fortune 500 companies such as Shell, Schneider Electric, and UPS Supply Chain Solutions.\n\nInvestors: A total of ~$270 million USD has been raised as yet. Most recently Series E round of $125 Million USD led by Warburg Pincus, with participation from existing investor SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Other investors include Cisco Investments, Eight Roads Ventures (A division of Fidelity Investments), Dragoneer, Peak XV Partners, and Stellaris Venture Partners.\n\nWhatfix’s AI journey has been an exciting one - This story is deeply tied to the story of how technology itself has evolved.\n\nIt began with the software era, when enterprise applications first digitized core processes across industries — a $650B opportunity. Then came the cloud and mobile era, a $2.7T wave of transformation that moved businesses from on-prem to SaaS and unlocked anytime, anywhere access. It was in this phase that Whatfix was born — helping enterprises accelerate digital adoption by making software easier to use, easier to learn, and easier to extract value from.\n\nThis intelligence powers our entire product suite. Digital Adoption helps users get productive faster. Product Analytics uncovers friction and closes adoption gaps. Mirror allows employees to train in safe, simulated environments. On top of these, our embedded AI Agents supercharge creation, insights, and user guidance.\n\nOur upcoming AI-first products are already creating a buzz in the market. Seek is an AI-native assistant that powers multiple enterprise use cases. Alongside Salesforce automation with “Seek for Salesforce Agent”, Seek also includes a conversational AI search tool that helps users find information faster in the flow of work. Together, these products reflect Whatfix’s commitment to building enterprise-ready AI teammates that maximize productivity and ROI. It gives users a unified, intelligent way to find answers across systems, apps, and knowledge silos and helps anyone looking to deliver fast and contextual answers.\n\nOur Mirror 2.0 helps teams practice real-world conversations using dynamic, AI-powered personas — whether it's sales, support, or compliance training. It is the world’s only System plus Role simulation with complete assessment to lead Gen AI simulation category.\n\nThe innovation that has gone into building these products has gained us 10 patents granted by the US patent office and we are already on our way to get a grant of 20 more patents with 2 specifically for the AI work we have done.\n\nWhat sets Whatfix apart is our ability to combine breadth and depth. Unlike point solutions that either stay confined to one ecosystem or solve only for onboarding, Whatfix works across web, mobile, desktop, OS, and AI-driven apps — and supports the entire transformation lifecycle from planning to training to continuous improvement.\n\nThe velocity of transformation has collapsed. What once took years now happens in quarters. Enterprises can’t afford to rely on outdated change management models and multi-year roadmaps. They need to adapt at the pace of AI. And that is the story of Whatfix: bridging the gap between exponential technological change and human enablement, ensuring that AI becomes not just embedded, but usable, trusted, and outcome-driven for every employee, across every system, in every workflow.\n\nWhatfix’s leadership is consistently recognized across top industry analysts and business rankings:\n\n* Only DAP to be recognized as a “Leader” across various DAP reports for the past 5+ years by leading analyst firms like Gartner, Forrester, IDC, and Everest Group.\n* With over 45% YoY sustainable annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth, Whatfix is among the “Top 50 Indian Software Companies” as per G2 Best Software Awards.\n* Named a Gartner Customers’ Choice for DAP for the second year in a row (2024 and 2025)—the only vendor in the market to earn this distinction consecutively.\n* We also boast a star rating of 4.6 on G2 Crowd, 4.5 on Gartner Peer Insights, and a super-high CSAT of 99.8%\n* Stevie Award winner in the category (Bronze): Customer Service Department of the Year – Computer Software - 100 or More Employees.\n* Won the 2025 AI \n* Breakthrough Award in the Overall AI-based Analytics Solution of the Year category\n* Winner of the ISG Paragon Innovation Award in partnership with Sophos (customer) for the EMEA region and finalist in the Transformation Award category.\n* RemoteTech Breakthrough Awards winner for “Software Asset Management Solution of the Year”These recognitions are matched by business performance:\n\n* Highest-Ranking DAP on 2023 Deloitte Technology Fast 500™ North America for Fourth Consecutive Year\n* Listed on the Financial Times & Statista's High-Growth Companies Asia-Pacific 2025 list.\n* Won the Silver for Stevie's Employer of the Year 2023 – Computer Software category and also recognized as Great Place to Work 2022-2023\n* Only DAP to be among the top 35% companies worldwide in sustainability excellence with EcoVadis Bronze Medal\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe are seeking a passionate Software Development Engineer (SDE) – AI Agents to join our team and contribute to building cutting-edge AI-powered systems. In this role, you will work on designing, developing, and deploying agentic AI applications that leverage large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and emerging frameworks like Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\nThis position is ideal for someone with strong engineering fundamentals (frontend or backend) who has hands-on experience experimenting with AI agents or related architectures and is excited to push the boundaries of autonomous and intelligent systems\n\nResponsibilities\n\n* Design and implement scalable AI-driven applications and systems, with a focus on agentic workflows and RAG pipelines.\n* Collaborate with cross-functional teams (frontend, backend, ML engineers, product managers) to integrate AI agents into existing products.\n* Build APIs, services, or UI components enabling interaction with agent-based systems.\n* Develop robust data pipelines for knowledge ingestion, context retrieval, and system orchestration.\n* Stay updated with advancements in AI agent frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, MCP, etc.) and apply them effectively.\n* Evaluate and optimize the performance of AI agents for real-world use cases.\n* workflows.\n* Write clean, maintainable, and testable code following best engineering practices.\n\nRequirements\n\n* 2–6 years of experience in software development (frontend or backend).\n* Proven proficiency in one or more programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, etc.).\n* Experience designing and deploying scalable systems (APIs, microservices, or distributed applications).\n* Hands-on exposure to at least 1–2 projects involving AI agents, RAG systems, agentic workflows, or MCP integrations.\n* Strong understanding of modern software development practices (CI/CD, cloud platforms, Git, containerization).\n* Familiarity with vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS) and LLM orchestration tools is a plus.\n* Ability to work in a fast-paced, collaborative, and innovative environment.\n\nNote:\n\n* At Whatfix, we thrive on the power of collaboration, innovation, and human connection. We strongly believe that working together in our office (five days a week) fosters open communication, builds a sense of community, and fuels innovation. This ensures open communication, strengthens our sense of community, and enables us to achieve our collective goals effectively.\n* At the same time, we recognize the importance of flexibility in balancing personal and professional priorities. To support this, we offer the option to work from home up to two days per month.\n* In any situation that requires additional flexibility, we’re open to considering exceptions on a case-by-case basis to ensure you’re supported in managing both work and life seamlessly.\n* We strive to live and breathe our Cultural Principles and encourage employees to demonstrate some of these core values - Customer First; Empathy; Transparency; Fail Fast and scale Fast; No Hierarchies for Communication; Deep Dive and innovate; Trust is the foundation; and Do it as you own it.\n* We are an equal opportunity employer and value diverse people because of and not in spite of the differences.

      "description": "Who are we? \n\nWhatfix is a leading global B2B SaaS provider and the largest pure-play digital adoption platform (DAP). Whatfix empowers organizations to maximize the ROI of their digital investments by tailoring it for the needs of each unique user. \n\nSpearheading the category with serial innovation and unmatched customer-centricity, Whatfix is the only DAP innovating beyond the category. Their product suite offers three powerful tools: Digital adoption to help users right within any software, no-code Product Analytics to uncover and resolve adoption gaps, and Mirror for application simulation, driving safe, hands-on learning in software replicas. \n\nThe company has seven offices across the US, India, UK, Germany, Singapore, and Australia and a presence across 40+ countries.\n\nCustomers: 700+ enterprise customers, including 80+ Fortune 500 companies such as Shell, Schneider Electric, and UPS Supply Chain Solutions. \n\nInvestors: A total of ~$270 million USD has been raised as yet. Most recently Series E round of $125 Million USD led by Warburg Pincus, with participation from existing investor SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Other investors include Cisco Investments, Eight Roads Ventures (A division of Fidelity Investments), Dragoneer, Peak XV Partners, and Stellaris Venture Partners.\n\nWhatfix’s AI journey has been an exciting one - This story is deeply tied to the story of how technology itself has evolved.\n\nIt began with the software era, when enterprise applications first digitized core processes across industries — a $650B opportunity. Then came the cloud and mobile era, a $2.7T wave of transformation that moved businesses from on-prem to SaaS and unlocked anytime, anywhere access. It was in this phase that Whatfix was born — helping enterprises accelerate digital adoption by making software easier to use, easier to learn, and easier to extract value from.\n\nNow we stand at the dawn of the AI era. Unlike past waves, this is not just another technology shift — it is foundational. AI is changing how work gets done, how decisions are made, and what skills are needed. The opportunity has expanded to more than $15 trillion, but it’s not just a software story anymore — it’s a labor story. Roles, workflows, and human-machine interactions are being rewritten in real time. And while AI promises speed and automation, it also introduces fragmentation, complexity, and a new kind of user friction.\n\nUserization: the belief that technology must adapt to the user, not the other way around. At the heart of this is ScreenSense, our proprietary AI engine, which continuously interprets both the context of what users are doing and the intent behind their actions. By combining these signals, Whatfix delivers real-time guidance, nudges, knowledge, and automation directly in the flow of work.\n\nThis intelligence powers our entire product suite. Digital Adoption helps users get productive faster. Product Analytics uncovers friction and closes adoption gaps. Mirror allows employees to train in safe, simulated environments. On top of these, our embedded AI Agents supercharge creation, insights, and user guidance.\n\nOur upcoming AI-first products are already creating a buzz in the market. Seek is an AI-native assistant that powers multiple enterprise use cases. Alongside Salesforce automation with “Seek for Salesforce Agent”, Seek also includes a conversational AI search tool that helps users find information faster in the flow of work. Together, these products reflect Whatfix’s commitment to building enterprise-ready AI teammates that maximize productivity and ROI. It gives users a unified, intelligent way to find answers across systems, apps, and knowledge silos and helps anyone looking to deliver fast and contextual answers. \n\nOur Mirror 2.0 helps teams practice real-world conversations using dynamic, AI-powered personas — whether it's sales, support, or compliance training. It is the world’s only System plus Role simulation with complete assessment to lead Gen AI simulation category.\n\nThe innovation that has gone into building these products has gained us 10 patents granted by the US patent office and we are already on our way to get a grant of 20 more patents with 2 specifically for the AI work we have done.\n\nWhat sets Whatfix apart is our ability to combine breadth and depth. Unlike point solutions that either stay confined to one ecosystem or solve only for onboarding, Whatfix works across web, mobile, desktop, OS, and AI-driven apps — and supports the entire transformation lifecycle from planning to training to continuous improvement.\n\nThe velocity of transformation has collapsed. What once took years now happens in quarters. Enterprises can’t afford to rely on outdated change management models and multi-year roadmaps. They need to adapt at the pace of AI. And that is the story of Whatfix: bridging the gap between exponential technological change and human enablement, ensuring that AI becomes not just embedded, but usable, trusted, and outcome-driven for every employee, across every system, in every workflow.\n\nWhatfix’s leadership is consistently recognized across top industry analysts and business rankings:\n\n* Only DAP to be recognized as a “Leader” across various DAP reports for the past 5+ years by leading analyst firms like Gartner, Forrester, IDC, and Everest Group.\n* With over 45% YoY sustainable annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth, Whatfix is among the “Top 50 Indian Software Companies” as per G2 Best Software Awards. \n* Named a Gartner Customers’ Choice for DAP for the second year in a row (2024 and 2025)—the only vendor in the market to earn this distinction consecutively.\n* We also boast a star rating of 4.6 on G2 Crowd, 4.5 on Gartner Peer Insights, and a super-high CSAT of 99.8%\n* Stevie Award winner in the category (Bronze): Customer Service Department of the Year – Computer Software - 100 or More Employees.\n* Won the 2025 AI \n* Breakthrough Award in the Overall AI-based Analytics Solution of the Year category\n* Winner of the ISG Paragon Innovation Award in partnership with Sophos (customer) for the EMEA region and finalist in the Transformation Award category.\n* RemoteTech Breakthrough Awards winner for “Software Asset Management Solution of the Year”\n\nBe one of the key Leaders in this awesome journey of building a billion-dollar company!\n\nOverview of the role: \n\nAssist the founders or functional leaders of a key function with varied strategic projects that are either Strategic and “Company Changing” enough and require dedicated time/resources/data to accomplish and/or projects that other groups should be doing but due to resource limitations are not able to execute successfully or in a timeline manner. The projects can be horizontal or can be specific to a function as well so you must be willing to learn and adapt quickly to different projects and teams, and execute projects to desired outcomes.\n\nSome highlights of the role: \n\n* The role involves navigating to various teams and leaders, to gather information or to drive a project, so understanding org structure, what all is happening and who does what becomes a must have and it helps if you can learn quickly. Everyone at Whatfix is operationally busy so getting time is difficult and being succinct and well prepared and using tools like Loom to communicate and set up meetings is important.\n* Good communication skills, both oral and written is a must have. Good listening and note taking skills are equally important.\n* There can be less correlation among the projects and assignments that come along so must be okay with context switching and ambiguity and must have the ability to prioritize and organize on a daily basis as you juggle between shorter duration and longer duration projects.\n* The role involves working as an individual contributor as you are not a direct people manager but involves indirectly managing different teams during projects and would also be fairly autonomous in nature. You should be comfortable with these aspects and be able to maintain a sense of urgency and clarity with limited oversight from the leader you are supporting, this could also vary based on the leader and the project you are working on. Again using asynchronous tools to collaborate is key.\n* A layer above all the above is varied work timings. The US Team in India works 5:30pm to 2:30am, EU team 1pm to 10pm and many others slightly earlier. Your ideal work timings will be from 3 PM to 12 AM.\n\nNote: \n\n* We strive to live and breathe our Cultural Principles and encourage employees to demonstrate some of these core values - Customer First; Empathy; Transparency; Fail Fast and scale Fast; No Hierarchies for Communication; Deep Dive and innovate; Trust, Do it as you own it; \n* We are an equal opportunity employer and value diverse people because of and not in spite of the differences. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status \n* At Whatfix, we deeply value collaboration, innovation, and human connection. We believe that being together in the office five days a week fosters open communication, strengthens our sense of community, and accelerates innovation—ultimately helping us achieve our goals more effectively. At the same time, we recognize the importance of flexibility in balancing personal and professional priorities. To support this, we offer the option to work from home up to two days per month.\n* In any situation that requires additional flexibility, we’re open to considering exceptions on a case-by-case basis to ensure you’re supported in managing both work and life seamlessly.",

      "description": "Data is at the core of modern business, yet many teams struggle with its overwhelming volume and complexity. At Atlan, we’re changing that. As the world’s first active metadata platform, we help organisations transform data chaos into clarity and seamless collaboration.\n\nFrom Fortune 500 leaders to hyper-growth startups, from automotive innovators redefining mobility to healthcare organisations saving lives, and from Wall Street powerhouses to Silicon Valley trailblazers — we empower ambitious teams across industries to unlock the full potential of their data.\n\nRecognised as leaders by Gartner and Forrester and backed by Insight Partners, Atlan is at the forefront of reimagining how humans and data work together. Joining us means becoming part of a movement to shape a future where data drives extraordinary outcomes.\n\nPosition Overview\n\nIn this hybrid role you will be responsible for both individual customer success and enabling the growth of the team. You’ll be responsible for managing a portfolio of growth-oriented customers in the U.S. (primarily mid-market sized companies) while simultaneously serving as a coach and support system for Growth Customer Success Managers. This role is critical for creating leverage for Atlan, ensuring consistent high-quality customer experiences, and helping teammates improve through feedback, shadowing, and hands-on coaching. Your goal is to ensure our customers not only adopt Atlan effectively but also achieve long-term value and success with our platform.\n\nWhat will you do? 🤔\n\n* Portfolio Ownership: Act as the primary point of contact for a defined book of 15-20 growth accounts in the U.S., guiding them toward long-term success and ensuring they achieve maximum value from Atlan. You'll own the end-to-end customer relationship, driving adoption, expansion, and renewal.\n* Pod Enablement: Provide day-to-day coaching and tactical guidance to a small team of Growth CSMs. Help them troubleshoot challenges, prioritize work, build confidence, and develop their skills to effectively manage their own customer portfolios. Serve as a go-to resource for both tactical problem-solving and strategic alignment. Serve as a sounding board to help them grow and succeed in their roles.\n* Scale Operational Excellence: Partner with Success Ops to refine internal processes, improve visibility into customer health, and build a scalable model. This includes contributing to playbooks, reporting dashboards, and other resources that enable the team to operate efficiently and effectively.\n* Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with Product, Sales, Solutions Engineering, and Support to ensure a seamless customer experience. Advocate for customer needs and provide feedback to internal teams to improve our product and services.\n* Thought Leadership: Contribute feedback loops into product, process, and strategy to elevate Atlan’s value across the customer lifecycle. Share your insights and best practices with the broader CS team and contribute to the development of thought leadership content.\n\nWhat makes you a great match for us? 😍\n\n* Proven Dual Capacity: Experience as a top-performing CSM or CS leader supporting mid-market data customers at scale, ideally with 1+ years in a team lead or mentorship role. You have a proven track record of successfully managing customer relationships and driving adoption, expansion, and renewals.\n* Strategic & Tactical: You’re equally comfortable presenting to a VP of Data and helping a junior CSM prep for a renewal call. You can seamlessly transition between high-level strategic discussions and hands-on tactical support.\n* Data Ecosystem Fluency: Deep understanding of modern data tools (e.g., Snowflake, dbt, Tableau, Looker) and the challenges of data teams at growing companies. You understand the data landscape and can effectively communicate the value of Atlan to technical and business audiences.\n* Process & Systems Mindset: You’ve helped build or improve CS workflows, playbooks, or reporting systems — and focus on improving 1% every day. You're passionate about creating scalable and efficient processes that enable the team to deliver exceptional customer experiences.\n* Growth-Oriented: You thrive in ambiguity and are energized by helping others grow through direct feedback and real-time coaching. You're a natural leader who is passionate about developing and mentoring others.\n\nWhy Atlan for You?\n\nAt Atlan, we believe the future belongs to the humans of data. From curing diseases to advancing space exploration, data teams are powering humanity's greatest achievements. Yet, working with data can be chaotic—our mission is to transform that experience. We're reimagining how data teams collaborate by building the home they deserve, enabling them to create winning data cultures and drive meaningful progress.\n\nJoining Atlan Means\n\n* Ownership from Day One: Whether you're an intern or a full-time teammate, you’ll own impactful projects, chart your growth, and collaborate with some of the best minds in the industry.\n* Limitless Opportunities: At Atlan, your growth has no boundaries. If you’re ready to take initiative, the sky’s the limit.\n* A Global Data Community: We’re deeply embedded in the modern data stack, contributing to open-source projects, sponsoring meet-ups, and empowering team members to grow through conferences and learning opportunities.\n\nAs a fast-growing, fully remote company trusted by global leaders like Cisco, Nasdaq, and HubSpot, we’re creating a category-defining platform for data and AI governance. Backed by top investors, we’ve achieved 7X revenue growth in two years and are building a talented team spanning 15+ countries.\n\nIf you’re ready to do your life’s best work and help shape the future of data collaboration, join Atlan and become part of a mission to empower the humans of data to achieve more, together.\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer\n\nAt Atlan, we’re committed to helping data teams do their lives’ best work. We believe that diversity and authenticity are the cornerstones of innovation, and by embracing varied perspectives and experiences, we can create a workplace where everyone thrives.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.About the Team The Observability team is part of Roku’s Cloud Technology Infrastructure organization and plays a critical role for our platform. We are a high-performing, fast-moving international team that thrives on ownership, effective communication, and delivering impactful engineering solutions. Our mission is to advance Roku’s observability platform, which operates at an impressive scale by ingesting terabytes of data daily and managing hundreds of millions of active series. As part of this mission, we focus on building scalable, performant systems to meet Roku’s unique needs. By leveraging open-source tools, CNCF-supported projects, and custom solutions, we enable engineering teams across Roku to monitor, debug, and optimize their applications with ease. What sets us apart is our results-driven culture rooted in ownership, accountability, and fast iteration. We prioritize solving meaningful engineering problems, fostering collaboration, and continuously improving how we work as a team. About the Role You will work on core observability systems (metrics, logs, traces) while also developing robust data pipelines and storage solutions optimized for high throughput, performance, and cost. You’ll leverage technologies such as time-series databases (TSDB), columnar storage formats (e.g., Parquet), and distributed data processing frameworks to advance the platform’s capabilities. Collaboration with cross-functional teams will be critical, as you’ll integrate observability into Roku’s cloud-native stack and contribute improvements back to the open-source community. Extend and integrate open-source observability systems, and when needed, structurally overhaul core components, such as storage layers and query paths, to improve performance, reliability, and usability of these tools at scale. Build services to improve performance, usability, reliability, and cost efficiency. Implement features like pre-aggregation, downsampling, and sampling to reduce load and accelerate queries. Create developer-facing capabilities for metrics, logs, and traces usage, data quality, and cost management. Automate onboarding, dashboards, alerting, and tracing. Collaborate across platform and infrastructure teams to integrate observability into Roku’s cloud-native stack. What We’re Looking For 8+ years in software engineering building distributed, high-throughput systems or observability platforms. 4+ years of Go experience; our observability ecosystem is Go-based, making it the most effective language for this role. Experience with, or strong interest in, observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, ELK/OpenSearch, Clickhouse) and standards (OpenTelemetry, OpenTracing, OpenMetrics). Deep understanding of distributed systems and data models Hands-on experience with Kubernetes, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure). BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.
